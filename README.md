# Notes Magic

This is a small magic trick that I developed. Maybe some other fellow magicians can use this trick as well and maybe, we can develop it further.

## Effect

The magician shows the top of a note on this phone's notes app. They say that they made a prediction and put it into this note and is revealed when scrolling down. The spectator is then asked to name any card of a 52 card deck. The selection process can be done by just asking, using an invisible or real card deck or whatever. When a card was chosen (e.g. the 8 of Hearts), the magician scrolls down in the note, which gradually gives more information about the prediction. This prediction matches the chosen card, so in the end, the correct card is mentioned in the note.

## How it works

This web app can be saved to the iOS homescreen as a bookmark, simulating the look an feel of the note view of the Apple notes app.

Based on the finger position while scrolling through the different steps of the process, the magician selects the chosen card.

## What's next?

Here are some ideas that could be implemented in this app in the future to make it even better:

- dark mode that follows the device's setting
- other languages
- custom texts for the prediction
- custom date of note
